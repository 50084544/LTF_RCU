# SSL Pinning Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect the application against Frida and objection script injection vulnerabilities, which could lead to SSL Pinning bypass.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Multiple Certificate Pinning

We've implemented multi-certificate pinning to avoid app breakage during certificate rotation:

- **Primary & Backup Certificates**: The application now supports multiple certificates (primary + backup).
- **Certificate Storage**: Certificates are stored in the assets folder and loaded at runtime.
- **Certificate Paths**:
  - Primary: `assets/certificate/login.salesforce.crt`
  - Backup: `assets/certificate/wildcard.ltfinance.com.pem`

### 2. Runtime Security Checks

We've added comprehensive runtime security checks to prevent tampering:

- **Anti-Debugging**: Detects attached debuggers and prevents debugging of the application.
- **Anti-Hooking**: Detects Frida, Xposed, Magisk, Substrate, and other hooking frameworks.
- **Time Manipulation Detection**: Prevents time-based attacks by detecting system time manipulation.
- **Periodic Security Checks**: Security checks run every 30 seconds to continuously protect the application.

### 3. Certificate Chain Validation

We've implemented proper certificate chain validation:

- **Full Chain Validation**: The application validates the entire certificate chain, not just the leaf certificate.
- **No TrustManager/HostnameVerifier Override**: We've avoided common security pitfalls by not overriding these classes.
- **Strict Hostname Verification**: The application strictly verifies that the certificate matches the hostname.

### 4. Self-Signed Certificate Rejection

We've added explicit checks to reject self-signed certificates:

- **Self-Signed Detection**: The application detects and rejects self-signed certificates.
- **Secure Default**: The application fails closed (secure by default) when certificate validation fails.

### 5. Advanced Security Features

- **SecureHttpClientAdapter**: Custom HTTP client that ensures proper certificate validation.
- **SecurityInterceptor**: Interceptor that checks security before allowing network requests.
- **Response Integrity Checks**: Validates responses for signs of tampering or proxy manipulation.

### 6. Native Security Checks

- **Android**: Native checks for root detection, hooking frameworks, and debugger detection.
- **iOS**: Native checks for jailbreak detection and debugging.

### 7. Multi-Layer Security Architecture

- **Application Startup**: Security checks run at application startup.
- **Before API Calls**: Security checks run before making API calls.
- **Periodic Background Checks**: Continuous security monitoring in the background.

## Conclusion

The implementation now addresses all the security concerns raised during the assessment:

1. ✅ Multiple certificate pinning
2. ✅ Runtime anti-debugging & anti-hooking checks
3. ✅ Proper certificate chain validation
4. ✅ Rejection of self-signed certificates

The application is now protected against Frida and objection script injection attacks that could lead to SSL pinning bypass.
